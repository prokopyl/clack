//! Allows plugins to present a GUI.
//!
//! There are two available approaches, either:
//!
//! * The plugin the plugin creates a window and embeds it into the host's window. This is often the
//!   preferred option, as it gives more control to the host, and feels more integrated.
//!
//! * The plugin creates an independent, floating window. This option should always be supported, at
//!   least as a fallback, in case window embedding is not available, which can be the case due to
//!   technical limitations.
//!
//! ## Opening a Plugin GUI
//!
//! In order to open a Plugin's GUI, Hosts must perform the following steps in order:
//!
//! * Call `is_api_supported` and `get_preferred_api` to negotiate a Windowing API to use.
//! * Call `create` to instantiate and allocate the Plugin's GUI resources.
//! * Decide whether the window will be floating or embedded.
//!   * If floating:
//!     * Call `set_transient` to make sure the Plugin's window stays above the Host's.
//!     * Call `suggest_title` to set the Plugin's window title to match the Host.
//!   * If embedded:
//!     * Set the plugin's GUI scaling using `set_scale`.
//!     * Check if the plugin's GUI can be resized by calling `can_resize`:
//!       * If it is resizeable and the hosts wants to give it a specific size (e.g. from a saved
//!         previous session), call `set_size`.
//!       * Otherwise, call `get_size` to get the initial size and adjust the parent window's client
//!         area accordingly.
//!     * Call `set_parent`.
//! * Call `show`, after which the host can call `hide` and `show` at will.
//! * Call `destroy` to free the GUI resources when the Host is done with it.
//!
//! ### Resize an embedded Plugin window.
//!
//! When the users drags to resize an embedded Plugin window, the Host must follow these steps to
//! negotiate a new window size for the plugin:
//!
//! * Check if the plugin's GUI can be resized in the first place using `can_resize`. Resizing
//!   should be completely prevented if this isn't the case.
//! * Determine a given `new_size` from the user's resizing action.
//! * Adjust it to something acceptable by the plugin by calling `adjust_size(new_size)` to get
//!   new `working_size`.
//! * Once negotiated, call `set_size(working_size)` to let the plugin redraw and resize its UI.
