//! Plugin audio processing types and related utilities.
//!
//! A plugin's audio processor can be in two states, either `started` or `stopped`, depending on
//! whether it is currently continuously processing audio, or has been put to sleep by the host,
//! respectively.
//!
//! These states are represented by the [`StartedPluginAudioProcessor`] and [`StoppedPluginAudioProcessor`]
//! types respectively, using a type-state pattern that only expose the methods that are valid for
//! the plugin's current state.
//!
//! Alternatively, users can also use the [`PluginAudioProcessor`] convenience type that internalizes
//! the state instead, and allows it to change and be checked at runtime.
