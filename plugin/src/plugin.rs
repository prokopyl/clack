//! Core types and traits to implement a Clack plugin.
//!
//! The [`PluginAudioProcessor`] trait is the main one required to be implemented for a Clack plugin. It
//! can also be associated to two more types, implementing [`PluginMainThread`] and [`PluginShared`],
//! following the CLAP thread model, as described below.
//!
//! # Thread model
//!
//! CLAP's thread model for plugins is split into three classes of operations: those happening in an
//! audio processing thread, those happening in the main thread, and thread-safe operations:
//!
//! * The *audio thread* (`[audio-thread]` in the CLAP specification): this is represented by a type
//! implementing the main [`PluginAudioProcessor`] trait (also named the audio processor), which is [`Send`] but
//! [`!Sync`](Sync), and is the only one required to implement a Clack plugin.
//!
//!   This type handles all DSP in one of the host's audio threads, of which there may be
//!   multiple, if the host uses a thread pool for example.
//!
//!   The host is free to [`Send`] the [`PluginAudioProcessor`] type between any of its audio threads, but any
//!   operation of this class is guaranteed to be exclusive (`&mut`) to a single audio thread.
//!
//!   One exception is for CLAP plugins' activation and deactivation (represented in Clack by the
//!   plugin type's construction and destruction), which is guaranteed to happen in the Main Thread
//!   instead. This allows the plugin's [`activate`](PluginAudioProcessor::activate) and
//!   [`deactivate`](PluginAudioProcessor::deactivate) methods to receive temporary exclusive references to the
//!   main thread type during its construction and destruction.
//!
//! * The *main thread* (`[main-thread]` in the CLAP specification): this is represented by a type
//!   implementing the [`PluginMainThread`] trait, which is neither [`Send`] nor [`Sync`]. If
//!   main-thread operations are not needed by a plugin implementation, `()` can be used instead.
//!
//!   This type can handle all non-thread-safe operations, such as those related to GUI handling,
//!   however extensions can extend its use to more kinds of operations.
//!
//!   The host cannot [`Send`] this type to any other threads, and this type has to be constructed
//!   before any other operation is done on the plugin.
//!
//! * *Thread-safe operations* (`[thread-safe]` in the CLAP specification) are represented by a type
//!   implementing the [`PluginShared`] trait, which is both [`Send`] and [`Sync`], and will be
//!   shared between the main thread and the audio thread. If it isn't needed , `()` can be used
//!   instead.
//!
//!   It can be used to hold read-only data (such as all of the detected host extensions), or to
//!   hold any other kind of synchronized state.
//!
//!   However, it should be noted that this type *can* be used by the host simultaneously from
//!   threads that are neither the main thread nor the audio thread.
